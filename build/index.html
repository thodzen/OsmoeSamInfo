            <hr>
            <p>For this project, we used Pug with Sass for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and PostgreSQL with ElephantSQL as the server for the database.</p>
            <p>During the development of this application, we learned a lot about connecting front-end and back-end, as well as interacting with a database.</p>
            <p>We also learned many things about UI/UX design and how to apply it to our future projects!</p>

        <p>A Motivational Web Application / Mobile Application </p>
        <p>Chris Spradlin, Brian Cox, Tyler Hodzen</p>
        <p><i>Abstract</i> – This paper reports on the development process of the web/mobile application, Osmoe Sam, as well as the human computer interaction aspects of this project.  This paper also details the scope of the project, the proposed milestones, and the milestones that would be completed in the future if given more time to work on the application.</p>
        <p>1 INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>        	Motivation applications are nothing new, but they usually focus solely on the individual. Osmoe Sam changes things by having each individual being held responsible for a virtual pet, Osmoe Sam. If the tasks that the user has entered are not completed daily, Osmoe’s health and happiness will start to waver. If the tasks are completed regularly, then Osmoe will remain happy and healthy.</p>
        <p>2. PROPOSED MILESTONES</p>
        <p>From the start, the scope of the application was to have a functioning motivational application that could work on both desktop and mobile devices.  This motivational application’s main focus was the virtual pet, Osmoe Sam.  For this virtual pet to be successful, the user needed to be able to interact with it, in turn, affecting Osmoe’s health and happiness.  The scope for this virtual pet was to have it react to the user’s motivational inputs, for example, “going to the gym” each day.  If the user does not keep up with his or her motivational inputs, Osmoe will start to get mad and will eventually begin to cry.  On the other hand, if the user continues to update their inputs regularly, Osmoe will remain happy and healthy.  This proposed milestone is a success, and a user is able to enter up to three tasks that he or she would like to complete throughout the day.  When successfully completing this task, and updating the app accordingly, Osmoe’s happiness, food, and or water meter(s) will rise, in turn, increasing Osmoe’s wellbeing.  If the user does not complete their tasks for a set amount of days, Osmoe will adapt to its lowered meters and will appear mad or sad, depending on how low the meters are.</p>
        <p>Having a responsive application so that Osmoe Sam can work on both desktop and mobile was also a high priority for this project that was able to be completed.  This allows the users to take Osmoe Sam with them, portably, creating a more user-friendly experience.</p>
        <p>2.1. FUTURE PROPOSED MILESTONES</p>
        <p>If the development of the Osmoe Sam application were to continue after the allotted time, proposed milestones would have more features and new milestones would be added.  If more development time was allotted to work on this project, the first large-scale feature that would be implemented would be a rewarding system that rewards users for completing their tasks daily.  Currently, there is no reward for keeping Osmoe happy, only punishment for making Osmoe sad.  This would be addressed by allowing users who consistently complete their tasks to earn and unlock accessories for Osmoe, such as hats, clothes, or decoration for Osmoe’s room.</p>
        <p>	Other future proposed milestones would consist of further interactions with the virtual pet, Osmoe Sam, so that the user would feel more attached to it.  Currently Osmoe has three emotions, happy, mad, and sad.  When a user clicks on Osmoe when it is happy or mad, Osmoe will react accordingly.  There is currently not a reaction for if Osmoe is sad.  If further developed, a sad reaction would be added.  Other interactions are also proposed, such as when you feed Osmoe, an animation will play of it eating.</p>
        <p>3. USER-CENTERED DESIGN</p>
        <p>        	Osmoe Sam is made for those who want to improve themselves by completing tasks daily until they become routine in the users’ lives and intended for those with access to the internet and who can use a personal computer. Osmoe Sam was designed for a large variety of populations, in regards to background, age, and education.  For the application to be successful for the user, he or she must use it each day to update the tasks they have completed for that day.</p>
        <p>        	Throughout the development process of the Osmoe Sam application, prototypes and mockups were shown to peers who could be potential users of the application.  From their input, better and more user-friendly interfaces were able to be modified and changed as development took place, creating an all-around better user experience.</p>
        <p>4. DATABASES</p>
        <p>	The database being used to store all of the user’s motivational information is PostgreSQL with ElephantSQL as the server for the database. There is one table in the database named ‘Users’ with columns named ‘username’, ‘email’, ‘password’, and ‘goals’. </p>
        <p>5. VISUALIZATION</p>
        <p>	Visualization was an important focus for this project, as the main draw of the application is a virtual pet that helps motivate the user.  This virtual pet, Osmoe Sam, displays its emotions visually to the user.  When Osmoe is happy, mad, or sad, the user is able to see this displayed through graphics and animation.  The graphic user interface also has elements of color-coding.  For example, the user interacts with Osmoe by giving it food, water, and happiness.  Anything dealing with these three interactions are color-coded, with food being green, water being blue, and happiness being yellow.</p>       
        <p>6. CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the development of the Osmoe Sam web application was successful.  The majority of the proposed milestones were able to be accomplished within the time given, and a solid final product was able to be completed.  The development team is very happy with the results.  </p>
